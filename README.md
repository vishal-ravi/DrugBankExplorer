DrugBankExplorer
Overview:

DrugBankExplorer is a powerful and versatile tool designed to facilitate the retrieval of drug-target interaction data from the DrugBank database. This repository is particularly useful for researchers, bioinformaticians, and pharmacologists interested in understanding the relationships between drugs and their biological targets. By enabling users to input target names dynamically, the tool provides a streamlined process for accessing relevant data, allowing for in-depth analysis and research.

Key Features:

Dynamic Data Retrieval:

Users can input any target name, and the tool will fetch all associated drug data from DrugBank.
The tool supports various target names, making it versatile for different research needs.
Pagination Handling:

The tool efficiently navigates through multiple pages of DrugBank search results, automatically transitioning to the next page until all data is collected.
This feature ensures that users can gather comprehensive information without manually navigating through pages.
Detailed Output:

Each data entry includes essential details such as:
Drug name
Target name
Association type
Additional links for further information
The output is structured for easy analysis, with all relevant information accessible in a user-friendly format.
Extensible Framework:

The code is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to modify or expand its functionality as needed.
Users can easily integrate additional features, such as data visualization or exporting to different formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).

## DrugBankExplorer

DrugBankExplorer is a Python-based tool designed to dynamically fetch comprehensive drug-target interaction data from DrugBank based on user-specified target names. By leveraging web scraping techniques, DrugBankExplorer automates the process of retrieving relevant information on targets and their associated drugs, creating a valuable resource for researchers, pharmaceutical professionals, and data scientists involved in drug discovery and bioinformatics.

### Features:
- **Flexible Target Search:** Input any target name (e.g., proteins, enzymes, or receptors), and DrugBankExplorer will fetch drug interactions related to that target from the DrugBank database.
- **Paginated Data Retrieval:** Handles multi-page data retrieval by traversing through pagination links until all available records are fetched.
- **Detailed Data Export:** Extracts essential information such as target names, drug names, and a detailed description link, allowing you to analyze or process data further.
- **Easy Data Handling:** Exports the fetched data to a structured Excel file for easy reference and integration with other tools or workflows.
  
### Future Enhancements:
- **Advanced Filtering Options:** Implement additional filters to refine searches based on drug approval status, type, or experimental stage.
- **Improved User Interface:** Potential development of a GUI for non-programmers to easily access and use the tool.
  
Whether you're exploring novel therapeutic targets or conducting a large-scale drug-target interaction study, **DrugBankExplorer** streamlines data collection, offering a valuable tool for bioinformatics research.
